- **u/dpaanlka** (reply, score 12): "Similar story here, 27 years and I feel more excited and committed to projects than I have in years."

### 2. The "One More Turn" Addiction (score: 54 + 64)

**u/youyouk** (score 54): "Same here, 'just one last thing...'"

**u/ZhopaRazzi** (reply, score 64): "Claude code is to me as an adult is what civ4 was to me as a kid. Just one more turn... wait, why the fuck is it light outside?"

- **u/LiveATheHudson** (reply, score 4): "I was just telling my wife how the hundreds of hours I spent on Civ 4 was actually training me to manage multiple ai agents and maintain coherence."

**u/Strict_Research3518** (score 2): "So I am not the only one at 3am having to get up at 7.. struggling to sleep because I need it to finish that last thing before I shut down? Nothing like starting a task at 3am that takes 45mins to complete! But then I need to test that results.. and then I need to reassure what I just did makes sense.. and then its 5am."

### 3. Every Day is Christmas (score: 63)

**u/silvrrwulf**: "Dude every day is Christmas"

### 4. Cured My Gaming Addiction (score: 49)

**u/DirectorWeary3256**: "I feel you so much. Literally cured me from my video games addiction, I can't even justify to myself to put work aside to play a bit (whilst it was quite the other way around, previously)"

- **u/Projected_Sigs** (reply, score 12): "It's completely magnetic & so satisfying to feel so hyper-productive... lesser things fall by the wayside. But based on the relatable feeling, im guessing you just swapped one addiction for another?"
- **u/heavyfriends** (reply, score 3): "Yeah most days now I don't even want to play games. It's wild, nothing has ever done that to me before"
- **u/RunsWith80sWolves** (reply, score 2): "True! It's the GLP-1 for Engineers. Cuts those cravings. Lose the inefficiencies."
- **u/x_typo** (reply, score 2): "same same... I usually game every single weekend but now? Its all about creating new apps/projects/skills to automate things/etc..."

### 5. Massive Migration in a Day (score: 38)

**u/r_rocks**: "Same, Senior iOS dev. Everyone complaining about Opus performance. Today I fully migrated 110 UIKit custom views to SwiftUI, with all the snapshots tests passing. With a nice python orchestrator bash loop, I don't even know python. It's ridiculous..."

### 6. Architecture Over Typing (score: 3, but insightful)

**u/pm_me_ur_doggo__**: "I was asked yesterday if I miss writing code by hand, and my answer was just 'no not really'. The type of code I enjoy writing is not the type of code that I use to build applications. The architecture and product skills were always my strength, and now I can lean into them more. I can see how if you were someone who likes to write the type of code that's much more technical and interesting that you'd hate where this is going."

### 7. Wisdom on Over-Engineering (score: 4)

**u/cosuna_ia**: "What you're experiencing isn't laziness or loss of skill - it's friction removal. When the cost of 'doing it right' drops to near zero, your inner craftsman goes wild.

The real risk isn't not coding - it's over-engineering without constraints. AI removes resistance, but resistance used to be the governor that forced prioritization.

The new senior skill isn't typing or even designing systems - it's deciding what not to build, when to stop, and when 'good enough' actually creates more value than 'perfect'.

Treat Claude like a power tool, not an IV drip. Ship value, protect scope, guard your energy. Otherwise yeah 'Hold my Claude' turns into burnout real fast."

### 8. Non-Programmer Building Real Systems (score: 2)

**u/ovrdev**: "I have a masters in electrical engineering. The only programming I got into was back in grad school doing matlab... I found myself in my startup needing some software to data log a set of modbus systems and more. I have barely slept since Christmas when I started. I can't sleep! I just keep thinking of new features, implementations, redundancies, cloud backup sync, web portal... I've done it all! It keeps growing. Real IP generation in this product I've built with incredible automated scripts. Levels of integration I didn't even know possible. Mesh nodes all sync's automatically to the GitHub repo. I didn't know any of this 2 months ago."

### Workflow and Tooling

- **u/x_typo**: "Lately I dont even use my IDE anymore. Same.... I barely touched my VS Code ever since I started using Claude Code in terminal..."
  - **u/LavoP** (reply): "What terminal you using? I still use CC in VSCode terminal but I feel like it's pointless now lol"
  - **u/x_typo** (reply): "iterm2"

- **u/Strict_Research3518**: "I use ZED..it's SUPER fast, light weight.. similar to every other IDE.. but just fires up instantly and gives me the basics of what I need today.. since 99% of my work is in the CLI now."
  - **u/Strict_Research3518** (follow-up): "Oddly.. after 30 years of IDEs.. I am finding using the CLI Claude faster to work with. I can't believe it myself as someone building desktop app based software. But man.. I seldom use the IDE."

- **u/NoMoreJello**: "I have serious time blindness and claude makes it worse so I set up a hook that sets the current time with every prompt. Then if it's after 11:00PM it will suggest that I wrap for the night every time I commit. Next I have to write one that detects if I'm working on my main project or farting around with skills, etc. and give me a kick in the ass if I've spent too much time on it. Have lost whole workdays to building tooling."

### Productivity Multiplier Effect

- **u/Diginic** (score 11): "I'm building out a dashboard for work for me and the team and it's been fantastic! I can throw in any feature I want, the way I want it and frankly, code doesn't have to be perfect, it's just nice to have over the many different scripts I used to use for all this stuff."

- **u/bzbub2** (score 3): "the only thing that i regret at this stage is not trying even more ambitious tasks with claude. I basically cleared out like 50 difficult backlog issues of varying sizes with claude. now backlogs empty and i have to literally start making some new problems for us to solve"

- **u/munkymead** (score 2): "'Post MVP' is no longer a thing now. Can't tell you off the top of my head how many projects I'm working on in parallel it's genuinely out of this world."

- **u/tribat** (score 3): "I focus on personal projects that I hope can one day release me from the shackles of my regular job. When I don't have much going on at work, I'm on my phone working with Claude code on one of my codebases. I can't remember when I modified any code. I'm just collaborating for a spec, getting other LLMs to review and improve it, then let Claude implement and use other agents to test."

- **u/Local-Collection1050** (score 3): "I have always had lots of ideas, but I would lose enthusiasm due to difficulties and a lack of technical skills. Now, I just do it. Every new day motivates me to continue working because I can see progress and reach goals one after another."

- **u/BitXorBit** (score 1): "100%, i was developer for over 10 years, in the past 2-3 years i took a break to 'escape the matrix', and since claude code im addicted again. 8-10 hours a day painting my visions into code"

### Mindset Shift

- **u/DrangleDingus** (score 5): "Legit it feels so incredibly exciting every day to just CREATE stuff again. This is the code-aissance like the Renaissance of moving bits around digitally and I am so fucking here for it."

- **u/RyanTranquil** (score 7): "Just said this to myself today .. now I look forward to getting up a little bit earlier to work on my side project or help make work more efficient"

- **u/BustOutRob** (score 1): "I switched over from copilot about a month ago. I've actually been enjoying going through random Bugsnag errors that were impossible to debug and little features I was putting off. Not only is it easier to solve, but Claude usually teaches me things too."

- **u/aabajian** (score 1): "Many of us got into computers because it was mysterious black box that could do anything if you but had the time and determination to code. As software got more complex, the time requirements became astronomical. Knowing you can build something, but also knowing the sheer slog it would take is a tough pill to swallow. That obstacle is gone and now anything is possible again."

- **u/Direct_Librarian9737** (score 3): "i feel like a software engineer for the first time in my career thnx to claude lol"

### Caution and Self-Care

- **u/trycoconutoil** (score 9): "Careful with eyes and other bodily stuff. I tend to be infront of the computer all day for days at a stretch these past months, but has consequence at least for me. Exercise and stare away from the screen to rest."

- **u/natu91** (score 1): "yes, easy to forget sleep, water or food."

### Testing Quality Warning

- **u/zeroconflicthere** (score 3): "The only thing I'll say about unit tests is some are fake it until you make it as in simulate instead of actually using the media"
  - **u/makinggrace** (reply, score 2): "The tests are atrocious. I don't think Claude understands tests other than they are a hurdle to jump. (Often it likes to just make the test simpler so it passes....um no.) I'm working with automating test stubs now before Claude touches it and providing allllllll of the test patterns. It's helping some."

### Code Review Reminder

- **u/shrupixd** (score 6): "Who's reviewing all of that? poor colleagues!"
  - **u/pm_me_ur_doggo__** (reply, score 8): "I'd really encourage you to get your juniors to review your code, and cross review each others code. Code review is just as much for the reviewer as it is for the reviewee."

### Skeptical Voices

- **u/Fickle-Wrongdoer-776** (score 0): "I would say use this energy somewhere else, we're contributing to our own destruction when we brag about how much more productive we are with AI for our stakeholders/managers."

- **u/_number** (score 0): "Yet you get paid the same or even less. All the code you write with it ends up bloating your software. Its wasted effort, not productivity."

### Tips Shared in Thread

- **u/x_typo** (tips for new users):
  - Use terminal, not IDE -- more flexible and you can run multiple sessions at once
  - Skills are your best friend -- if you notice yourself doing the same thing over and over again, create a skill for it
  - Ask Claude itself for workflow optimization tips

## Extracted Tips and Patterns

### Productivity Workflow Tips

1. **Use the terminal directly** -- Many devs have abandoned IDE-based editing entirely and work through Claude Code in a terminal (iTerm2, Zed, IntelliJ terminal). The IDE becomes just a terminal host.

2. **Orchestrate with bash loops** -- u/r_rocks migrated 110 UIKit views to SwiftUI in one day using a "python orchestrator bash loop." Automating repetitive Claude Code tasks with scripting amplifies throughput.

3. **Clear the boring backlog first** -- u/bzbub2 cleared 50 backlog issues. The tedious tasks that nobody wanted to do are now trivially achievable. This builds momentum and credibility.

4. **Create Skills for repetitive patterns** -- u/x_typo recommends creating Claude Code skills for anything you do repeatedly.

5. **Use hooks for self-management** -- u/NoMoreJello set up a hook that injects the current time with every prompt and suggests wrapping up after 11 PM. Useful for managing the addictive "one more turn" loop.

6. **Multi-agent parallel workflows** -- Several users mention running multiple Claude sessions simultaneously on different tasks or features.

7. **Let Claude handle documentation** -- The OP points to 100% test coverage, JavaDoc, and Word documents as things Claude handles effortlessly that were previously skipped.

8. **Use other LLMs for review** -- u/tribat describes a workflow: "collaborating for a spec, getting other LLMs to review and improve it, then let Claude implement and use other agents to test."

### Mindset Shifts

1. **From coder to architect/PM** -- The role shift from "person who types code" to "person who designs systems and directs implementation" is the central theme. Architecture and product skills matter more than typing speed.

2. **Friction removal unleashes creativity** -- When the cost of implementation approaches zero, ideas that were "nice to have" become actually buildable. The bottleneck moves from execution to imagination and prioritization.

3. **The new senior skill is knowing what NOT to build** -- u/cosuna_ia's key insight: AI removes the resistance that used to force prioritization. The discipline to stop, ship, and guard energy becomes the differentiator.

4. **"Post MVP" is dead** -- When implementation is cheap, the distinction between MVP and polished product collapses. Multiple parallel projects become feasible.

5. **Veterans are re-energized** -- Programmers with 20-45 years of experience report feeling excited about coding again. The accumulated architectural knowledge becomes more valuable, not less.

6. **Non-programmers can build real systems** -- u/ovrdev (EE background) built production-grade systems with mesh nodes, GitHub sync, cloud backup, and web portals in 2 months with no prior software experience.

### Risks and Warnings

1. **Burnout risk is real** -- Multiple comments describe staying up until 3-5 AM, forgetting sleep/food/water. The addictive quality of frictionless productivity can be harmful.

2. **Test quality is a concern** -- Claude tends to write tests that pass rather than tests that validate. Users recommend pre-writing test stubs and providing explicit test patterns.

3. **Over-engineering without constraints** -- When everything is easy to build, the temptation to gold-plate is strong. Need discipline around scope.

4. **Code review still matters** -- Getting juniors to review AI-generated code is important both for code quality and for their learning.

5. **Physical health** -- Screen time increases dramatically. Eye strain, sedentary behavior, and disrupted sleep are common.

6. **Don't advertise your 10x to management** -- Some caution about revealing productivity gains to stakeholders who may adjust expectations or headcount.
