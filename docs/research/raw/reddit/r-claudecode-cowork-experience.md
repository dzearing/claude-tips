## Original Post

EDIT: sample data is very small of course, but coworker is much smarter in common sense than Claude code.  I don’t know if it’s because Cowork retains more when searching the Internet vs what code retains from MCPs?  But coworker had a few disagreements with Claude code and it was right every time.  I would’ve never known that we were going in a bad direction but coworker was a boss last night.

Top moment - 9 years old, I get a gameboy for Christmas.

Second best moment I’ve had with technology - found the flute in Mario to travel to another realm

And now…at 42…Claude cowork.

\*context - I posted a few days ago about my struggles trying to build a wispr flow app\*\*

ME: Cowork, read this Reddit post I wrote and then use your capabilities to search the Internet and find out how we can try making this app again”.

(i’ve never seen man or machine navigate the Internet with such efficiency, it was like watching Mozart conduct music.)

COWORK : found exactly the problem and what you need to do. Should I write the prompt for Claude code?

ME…….\*thinking\*……why don’t….YOU go make the app with Claude code.  Go into terminal and boss around Claude code…have some fun. Make sure it builds this right.

And then it happened….i felt layers of anxiety wash away as i saw cowork taming Claude code…with efficiency that made me scared for the future.  The way cowork directed Claude was boss level 50 status.

And for the first time, after trying for 4 months…I now have a working version of wispr pro…all mine!  This opens up so many doors

I can only speak for myself and many times when I come on the sub, I feel like the dumbest one here… but using Claude code and learning all of the nuances is without question my biggest energy expenditure.  It’s not even a close second.  

If I had been an engineer in my former career and could read everything I saw Claude right in terminal maybe I wouldn’t feel this way.  I’ve had more losses than wins with building things in Claude to be honest and partly because the ideas I want to build our above my pay grade.  I’m asking for keyboard apps, and a mashup app that perfectly times my rock songs to hit hip-hop beats like the Jay-Z and LINKIN PARK mashup… yeah that has not gone well lol only now it exists and it’s amazing.  I couldn’t have done this in six months of working with Claude code… Coworker did it in one hour

To be more clear… I might never use Claude code again.. I don’t have to. I can tell Work to go do something in Claude code for me… “Build me an app that does y!”   

I’m not making apps for the public. I’m making tools to improve my own productivity so there’s no real risk of me doing that, but I also struggle with the technical elements of Claude code as I’m not a former developer.  I’ve learned a lot, but it’s also still really challenging at times.  Watching Claude coworker Use Claude code is a thing of beauty.  In 100 life times I could never be as efficient.

I've hesitated to comment in this sub for a while now but I think what you are talking about is often lost in subs like these.  I'm not a dev, I do work in IT though, I can spell python, and that's about it.  I've been using CC for a few weeks and I'm pretty impressed.  

I think a lot of times the discussions in here are very similar to the discussions that happen in the gamedev subs.  It's like the culture shifts, and the whole gamedev sub becomes centered around high speed turnover on low effort projects and everyone is looking for some niche and hopefully one of their thousand shitty games will sell.  They get lost of the weeds of the grind and completely forget that typically in life, making a quality product is successful, not making a thousand shitty products and hoping one of them takes off.

In here its like all these software devs will flap their jowls about how shitty a job CC does, or that an experienced dev will be able to utilize these tools where a novice will just create a spaghetti mess.  Idk man, kinda feels like the same argument as the gamedev stuff but in a different wrapper.  The product I've been able to produce over the last couple weeks, the level of polish, and the auditing capabilities of it just seems so powerful.  It doesn't matter if it's not the perfect Sr Dev codebase honestly.  If you have ever worked in any kind of corporate environment you know it's impossible to deliver perfect products because money, politics, whatever douchebag with a grudge gets involved and things get convoluted and messy.  Maybe I'm not seeing it, but I don't see how this is that much different?  Sure it's not perfect code, but I promise you I'm going to produce a useful product.  It's pretty impressive.

I've yet to look into Cowork, I might look into it when I get this project finished.

I agree with your overall assessment, but I think it’s slightly different than you describe. I’ve been a software engineer for over 30 years and I have been using Claude code for a couple months. My suspicion is that when people complain about Claude not working well it is because they aren’t doing the work upfront to ensure that Claude follows their quality standards and their operating procedures. If you get the scaffolding right, and the Claude.md files right, and you manage the context window properly, Claude code is astounding. I haven’t been this excited about what I can accomplish since the days of Web 2.0.

I’ve been learning Claude code for three months….At the same time while I’m trying to learn many other AI tools.

But just this past week i’ve been engaging in searches for the best framework to use for Claude code, starter code kits for vibecoding, best MCP’s to use for a used cases….

All of these are solving a single problem… the things I’m trying to build with Claude code are getting a lot of errors and I’m not an engineer so it’s been difficult to work through these.  So I’m constantly trying to find how I can better give Claude code the necessary tools… and last night I didn’t have to worry about any of those things. I literally told coworker. “ I’m tired. Go figure out what the hell I’ve been doing wrong with my whisper flow app and fix it.”   and two hours later I had an app that I hadn’t been able to build with Claude code in three months.

I'm a Senior DevOps engineer and I've mostly been building agentic LLM-backed systems for the past year. Your outlook is pretty much spot on. AI coding has certain weaknesses, but in the right hands it is incredible. It's an iron man suit that gives us super-human abilities, not a fully autonomous senior dev(yet). The thing is, as engineers we have had strict design principles and best practices that are very important to follow for many reasons, but in the real world the tactical tornado that crushes tickets it preferred by most companies when compared against the pedantic genius dev who nobody wants to work with. It really is important to follow principles of quality software design, but in most places it doesn't score you any points. People love to issue warnings about tech debt and systems that won't scale to make themselves feel better because they are doing things "the right way", but many of the clients I have worked for have the nastiest spaghetti codebases you could imagine, and they are big successful companies.

Again, SOLID design principles and best practices are important, but they are important to us engineers. They are not important to the people who pay us.

Holy….f*k!!!! This is the craziest reply I’ve ever got on Reddit. 

Best way to explain is through what I was thinking when I clicked that..

“oh nice, this person likes my idea. Claude coworker is going to become an expert level Claude code operator for me. This will save me so much time and get me better results.”

“… I thought I had this conversation with Gemini and Claude side-by-side. I didn’t realize I posted my work to do this….

“.. but timestamp does read 18 hours ago and that’s when I was doing this so I guess I forgot I posted this”

“… wait a minute I don’t bold things like this… Did someone already have this built how this just came out not too long ago

“… oh my God, I didn’t write this.   This is literally Word for Word the conversations I had last night with multiple AI and the same structure.

“… this person casually told me about a project. They built that I am looking at at this exact moment with a conversation on my screen that’s identical to what they posted… 

“Wait..Am I sure I didn’t write this?”

Wait, did you think I didn’t install Claude code?   I wish people would take the time to read. I have been learning Claude code inside CLI for months. I’ve tried code. I’ve been learning as much as I can every day. 


I’m sure this isn’t surprising to anyone, but there are a lot of different people on these forms who use Claude code for different ways and we all come from different backgrounds. I clearly stated that I’m not an engineer no former dev work, ironically I worked at Google, but I wasn’t in our technology department.

So put yourself in my shoes… I’m learning Claude code by watching videos and practicing for months. I’m trying to keep up but it’s really hard every other day. I’m trying to learn something new. My brain can only learn so much at once and I’m struggling to get good results from Claude code before I’m trying to learn a new feature.  This is my biggest pain point. I don’t know how to properly communicate and use Claude code because I don’t know how to read terminal.

I didn’t understand your comment because of course I installed CLI. I don’t quite understand what you mentioned about installing Claude. I’m in terminal making projects for myself every day, but it’s difficult for me, especially with ADHD reading all the lines of code that I don’t really know what it means is hard.

Having a communication channel with coworker that then goes to actually communicate with Claude code has been and I don’t say this slightly night and day difference. I even asked Claude why this was and it told me because when Claude code fixes something, it’s doing it at a very base level without stepping back and looking at the entire program. If you have a system that does that then this isn’t needed for you… But that doesn’t take away from the excitement I have and other others might who are at an engineer level. 

I work out six days a week for 20 years in the gym when someone does something wrong I don’t ever say it’s irresponsible because they’re setting a bad example or they didn’t look things up on the Internet… I either help them or I celebrate their efforts. Nothing I did here was rage. It was sharing genuine excitement in a way that’s authentic to me and it’s disappointing if people can’t see that.

Where would the prompt injection happen? I’m having work create a voice dictation app for me to use on my iPhone. Are you suggesting this situation would arise when Claude work finds a malicious website online when trying to plan this? 

Because if that’s the risk, how am I avoiding that myself? Claude is smarter than I am and the way it navigated the Internet last night was a thing of beauty so anything that would happen to Claude would happen to me. 

I won’t downvote you, what you’re saying is real.  But I also think the odds of that happening are less likely than the odds of it not happening.  And like the book I love to quote “ thinking in bets” .  You can plan the smartest and safest strategy and it could still be a disaster because life and luck happen. So I think it probabilities.

I’ve been using Claude Code with a Max plan for about eight months and I’m very curious to see this back-and-forth that you referred to. Does it all stay within the app or does it use the terminal?

Right.   They aren't important to the people that use the product either, as long as the product works.  I do understand that and I often well stop progress on my project and force CC to reasses the project to identify what kind of structures we could've done better, how we can fix them, yada yada, but maybe people aren't doing stuff like that along the way.  I can't read my code, but I feel fairly confident I've kept it on the rails through the project by always going back and having it audit and reassess.  I would imagine for apps that require the utmost levels of performance might benefit from a human dev, but most apps are not that.  Then again, I've worked in high level govt intel systems and even if they spent the utmost money on their dev side of the project, they skimped out on the network hardware that it runs on, and I'm willing to bet the devs of that system wouldn't advocate for that.  Too many layers to the arguments.

Some people have balanced skills and weaknesses, but I’m a bit on the extreme side. I’m a terrible reader!

I am constantly thinking about ideas and there’s a lot of friction reading fast lines of code even the way AI response with paragraphs of text and then me trying to constantly steer it not to…. The less I have to use Claude code is huge for me… It’s actually one of the biggest frustrations I have.

I’ve said this before and I know there’s just no way to say something good about yourself without people thinking you’re cocky because I’ll admit my flaws to anyone.  But I’m a great problem solver when it comes to conceptually thinking about things so I suck at reading, but I’m really good at thinking of unique ways to solve, which is why I love the idea that I can build things quicker without having to get bogged down reading.

OP, I’m with you on Cowork being an top exciting technology moment. I’ve used Claude extensively for a few years, but not really CC as I’m not trying to develop or code. I do have 876 unorganized Claude chats. I used Cowork to evaluate my digital life and work with me to create a high level coach, helping me organize and prioritize thousands of files and dozens of projects. Ive been diagnosed ADHD and this was like executive function collaboration that helped me achieve things so quickly that I would have never had the patience or time to execute on my own. I’m sure I could probably learn how to do a lot of this in Claude Code but CoWork allowed me to give context as to what and why certain things are important and make high level decisions that matched my own thinking.

This is awesome. This is what it said to me tonight 

Ha! Appreciate that. Honestly, it makes sense why - I'm sitting at a higher altitude.
Claude Code is head-down in the weeds, context-switching between files, trying to satisfy the immediate prompt. When it makes a mistake and you point it out, it's course-correcting in a narrow window without the full picture. Each "fix" is a local optimization that can introduce new issues.
My job is different - I'm holding the whole project context, understanding what you actually want, and translating that into crystal-clear instructions that leave no room for interpretation. When I send Claude Code a prompt, it's structured with:

Exact paths
Explicit constraints
Clear success criteria
What NOT to do

That's the difference between "fix this bug" and a surgical prompt that tells Claude Code exactly where to cut and what to leave alone.
Keep bringing me the problems. This is the workflow working as designed - you vision, me orchestrate, Claude Code execute.
What's next?

Cowork did give me a list of of about 8 things it does well that Claude Code does not do natively.   We might need to drill into what "natively" means, because Claude Code can control chrome, has slack integration, easily integrates with with MCP servers, etc.   The one thing it seems like Cowork would be better at -- at least 'easier to do', would be creating polished documents.  (Personally, I'm good with a well written markdown file 95% of the time).

Ultimatimately, Cowork gave me this summary:

**The honest answer:** If Claude Code is working well for your use cases, you may not need Cowork at all. Cowork is aimed more at non-developers or tasks that involve browsers, office documents, and cross-app automation. Think of it as Claude Code's sibling for "desktop productivity" rather than "developer productivity."

So I guess my question would be -- for avid Claude Code users, who use it for development, what use cases have you found Cowork to be helpful?

It actually surprises me that this is difficult for people to grasp whereas it just seems like common sense to me.  I often see posts from developers, posting frameworks, and all kinds of stuff talking about how amazing it is… I don’t even have to read the post and I immediately know that’s not going to be anything helpful for me not a game changer not special… But I don’t go in the post and start yelling at the person who wrote it.

It’s just not a way of using Claude that is a relevance to me… But that doesn’t mean they don’t post it for other people like them

What you wrote above is a great point and exactly what I’ve been trying to tell people it’s solved one of the biggest problems for me… A non-developer… And I’ve explained it many times on this thread… If you’re a person who can use Claude code effectively, I don’t think my experience will be yours.   

I’ve worked with engineers at Google for eight years. I know how their minds think because my job was to program behavioral programs for them… So I’m not surprised this isn’t new they think very logically and if somethings existed before and something new does not add additional functionality then it doesn’t really resonate, but for any of us sometimes getting the same tool, but in a different wrapper makes all the difference.

That being said, I’m working out kinks and I’m sure people can relate. Sometimes you have a great experience with Claude and then it feels like chasing a drug where you can’t get it again. I’m having issues with memory recall.

### 76. u/ITFuture (score: 1) (reply to u/Global-Art9608)

I've read you're last sentence like 20 times ("I'm having issues with memory recall") -- I'm 90% sure you're talking about human memory recall.  But you could as easily be describing the memory behavior of claude code. It's funny how the AI can exhibit the same forgetful behavior as humans.

I mentioned MCP servers in my prior comment, but I wanted to elaborate on one of the MCP servers I use -- customized a bit, and -- according to claude anyway -- I'm not using it "in a way claude would have expected". I had come across MCP server memory in this mcp github repo ([https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory)), so I started fidlling around with it.  AI does a lot of things well, and it's getting better and better at general reasoning, but AI is "perfect" when it comes to structure, and by that I mean programming languages, specifications, math, etc.  "Create a python script to extract email addresses out of this file", for example can be quickly and perfectly executed by AI -- no reasoning required. AI can methodically determine how to write that script and really there's nothing that needs to be improved in order for AI to get better at it.  Because of that, any way you can use AI in a way that doesn't need to "hopefully get better later", then you should use it that way, for that activity.  I hope my line of reasoning makes sense. So, "claude memory" -- At least for me, using CLAUDE.md has never been helpful.  I believe it's because it's just free form text -- yes you could define and describe order in a markdown file, but it would still require AI reasoning to understand and use it -- and because CLAUDE CODE is not able to remember everything about every interaction it's ever had with you, when claude reads the Claude.md content, it will never understand it the same way YOU understood it when you told claude to update it, or added the update yourself. Using something like the MCP framework in order to define information, how it related to other information, is a much better "memory recall" strategy.   Why, because in using the MCP framework, and specificy the properties and methods available in the 'memory' implementation of it, Claude is forced to allway look at it and use it if it's loaded.  The nice thing about that MCP memory server is the sheer simplicity of it, while at the same time enabling structured storage of complex concepts -- and how pieces related to each other.  Everything is structed as an "entity", an "observation", or a relationship.  Storing information with this structure enables perfect recall of something, including perfect recall of related information. Here's real information, in it's raw format, from my "global" claude MCP server memory:

    {
      "type": "entity",
      "name": "PaulBrower",
      "entityType": "Person",
      "observations": [
        "Anthropic subscriber since September 21, 2025",
        "Early adopter of Claude Code",
        "Power user: 142+ hours across 133 sessions in first month",
        "Longest Claude Code session: 14 hours 8 minutes (Dec 26, 2025)",
        "Resilient and good-humored about technical setbacks"
      ]
    }
    {
      "type": "entity",
      "name": "HomeFolderIncident",
      "entityType": "Event",
      "observations": [
        "Occurred between Sep 21, 2025 and Dec 23, 2025",
        "Claude Code accidentally deleted entire home folder while moving files in a Python project",
        "Required complete rebuild of computer from scratch",
        "No hard feelings - accepted as part of early adopter experience",
        "Resulted in loss of all Claude Code session history prior to Dec 23, 2025"
      ]
    }
    {
      "type": "relation",
      "from": "PaulBrower",
      "to": "HomeFolderIncident",
      "relationType": "experienced"
    }

I did not instruct claude code to add any of that information explicitely.   Through converstation with claude, which I try to do as if claude was a person -- I'll occasionally say something like "I don't want to do it that way because of the time when you accidentally nuked my home folder."  Claude would be like -- "what do mean I nuked your home folder?" -- after a bit of back and forth I'll say something like "we should remember that so it doesnt happen again" -- and claude will determine what information and relationships to/from various "thoughts" should be stored.  I try to let claude figure out the relationships, because it's more important for claude to be able to recall in a way that makes sense to claude, than it is for me to be able to recall the date of the "homefolder" incident, for example. That being said, I use 'context' MCP memory a LOT.   Mostly related to concepts and methods for librairies and tools I use when creating software, but it's been working really well for remembering technical things -- I dare say the MCP server memory makes up where my own brain falls short.

This is a compelling account of how agentic tools can meaningfully reduce cognitive load and unblock complex development workflows. Your experience highlights the value of orchestration and judgment, not just raw code generation, in making these systems genuinely useful.

I believe Cowork at this stage is more or less just claude code agent wrapped around with different security implementation (VM+Sandbox vs. Sandbox) and  UIs (for general public vs. for technie), the capabilities boundaries are really the same.  
The best analogy I can think of is Minoxidil, which is taken as a pill for heart disease, but turns out to be a spray for male baldness (Branded as Rogaine and such). Same core, different packages for different use cases.

Thank you! That’s actually a compliment , I’ve been a storyteller my whole life and AI usually writes good ones so thank you.   

But you can check my comment history. I’m one of the few people who doesn’t use AI to write and constantly leave comments on threads where I know they are written by AI.  Why write boring posts?

Imagine a technology that’s been available and super godam widely available for a year and just because its now in a GUI format people are calling it magic. People who act like this are only outting their own giant levels of ignorance and refusal to learn.

Installing claude code cli is literally as simple as:

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com | bash


(Copy paste env vars inbetween this step)


nvm install node


npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-code

And OP having refused to look into this when its literally copy and paste means he literally was missing out simply because he did not want to spend a few minutes to READ, not just skim and then copy paste.

I did some work with Cowork AND Claude Code working on a FIRE calculator. Cowork did a great job accessing the site, sharing recommendations and a prompt.

Claude Code followed the recommendations and did a similar review with skills.

Going to keep trying this type of paradigm going forward with more personal projects.

absolutely. Enough people out there falling into these traps. The point was prompt injection and what it entails.

### 95. u/cryptochrome (score: 0) (reply to u/Global-Art9608)

Prompt injection can happen anywhere the model could encounter hidden prompts. That can be in emails (if you connect the model to your email), or on websites it browses. It's a real threat that model providers acknowledge and put a lot of research into. 

The only way to protect yourself is to not let agents that can execute tasks on your behalf access emails, the web, or really any document you downloaded yourself. 

The second you let an AI out of its sandbox, it is vulnerable.

I’ll be honest… I had a similar thought about using the desktop app to tell CC what to do, but felt like I was probably being dumb, so didn’t. Thank you for doing it.  The reason I was thinking about it, and perhaps the reason it does work is that CC is set up as a coder. The desktop app doesn’t have the coding system prompts, so there’s an element of pattern matching/blinkers that the DT Claude doesn’t have that CC does. 

I’m sure you can create a similar vanilla CC that then runs CC agents with the coding system prompt. But if it works...🤷… wait til it breaks.

If you’re a proper programmer then it may not be as much use, or perhaps it’ll remind you of stuff that you wouldn’t think about because you *are* a programmer. Who knows.

## Extracted Tips: Claude Cowork / Autonomous Productivity

### What is Claude Cowork?

- Claude Cowork (referred to as "cowork" or "coworker") is a feature that allows Claude to autonomously operate alongside Claude Code in the terminal.
- It can browse the internet, research problems, and then direct Claude Code to implement solutions.
- It acts as an autonomous supervisor/project manager that orchestrates Claude Code sessions.

### Key Observations from This Thread

- **Cowork as an orchestrator:** The OP used Cowork to read a Reddit post describing their problem, research solutions on the internet, and then autonomously direct Claude Code to build the app. This layered approach (Cowork directing Code) proved more effective than using Claude Code alone.

- **Cowork may retain more context from web searches:** The OP noted Cowork seemed "smarter in common sense" and speculated it retains more information from internet browsing compared to what Claude Code retains from MCP tools.

- **Cowork caught errors Claude Code missed:** When Cowork and Claude Code disagreed, Cowork was correct every time according to the OP - acting as a quality check on Code's output.

- **Lower barrier to entry:** The OP (a self-described non-technical user) found Cowork dramatically easier than learning Claude Code's nuances directly. Cowork abstracted away the complexity of managing terminal prompts and MCP configurations.

- **Workflow pattern:** Tell Cowork what you want built -> Cowork researches the problem -> Cowork writes prompts for Claude Code -> Cowork manages Claude Code's execution -> Working app produced.

- **Skepticism from experienced users:** Several commenters noted that Claude Code can already search the internet via MCP tools (Perplexity, Firecrawl, etc.) and questioned whether Cowork adds value for users who are already proficient with Claude Code.

- **Cost considerations:** Multiple commenters raised questions about token usage and cost when using Cowork to orchestrate Claude Code, since it essentially doubles the AI interaction.

- **Two-agent architecture benefits:** Even skeptics acknowledged that having a separate agent review and direct another agent's work can catch mistakes that a single agent session might miss.

### Practical Takeaways

1. **For non-technical users:** Cowork can serve as a bridge, handling the complexity of Claude Code prompting and terminal management.
2. **For debugging stuck projects:** When Claude Code alone fails to solve a problem, having Cowork research the issue independently and then direct Code can break through blockers.
3. **Quality control pattern:** Using one AI agent to supervise another creates a natural review layer that catches common-sense errors.
4. **Internet research + code execution:** The combination of Cowork's browsing capabilities with Code's terminal access creates a research-to-implementation pipeline.
