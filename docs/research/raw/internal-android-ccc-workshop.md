# Mobile Team Accelerates AI-First Development (Immersive Workshop)

**Source:** Internal team site
**Author:** Principal Architect, Mobile Team
**Date:** January 2026
**Type:** Internal case study -- team AI adoption initiative

---

## Summary

One mobile development team. 8 days of immersion. 32 prompt PRs merged. A cultural shift toward agent-first engineering.

The team completed an immersive workshop -- a strategic onsite initiative that transformed how developers work with AI tools, achieving measurable adoption gains and producing reusable assets for the entire organization.

"The workshop was an experiment: could we accelerate AI adoption through immersive learning rather than gradual rollout?"

**The answer is yes.**

- **32 prompt PRs merged** across multiple repositories
- **14 contributors** participated actively in building shared AI workflows
- **Baseline to Target**: AI adoption tracking from 40% to 70% adoption goal by end of January
- **Week 1**: Intensive workshops covering agent-first development, AI-assisted code review, code modernization, and data exploration
- **Week 2**: Independent practice on real backlog work with continued mentor support

### Why This Matters

This wasn't a training exercise -- it was real work. Every prompt file merged represents a repeatable workflow that any team member can use. From unit test generation to localization bug extraction to PR review automation, these assets compound value across every future development cycle.

## What They Built

### Week 1: Immersive Workshops

Each morning featured hands-on sessions led by team members who had already made the agent-first shift:

| Day | Topic |
|-----|-------|
| Tuesday | Agent-First Development & Prompt Engineering |
| Wednesday | AI-Assisted Code Review |
| Thursday | Code Modernization (Java to Kotlin) |
| Friday | Data and Telemetry Exploration |

**Key technical patterns that emerged:**

- **Meta-prompting**: Agents refine their own prompts based on feedback
- **Sub-agent orchestration**: Distributed execution with meta-review for quality validation
- **Context > Model Selection**: Rich, relevant context matters more than which AI model you use
- **90% code coverage as the new norm**: Agent-generated tests make comprehensive coverage practical

### Week 2: Practice Week

Developers returned to their regular work with a new mindset: "Can an agent do this?" became the first question before starting any task. The reduced delivery pressure allowed skill consolidation without sacrificing real output.

## Happy Surprises

- **Claude Code access opened mid-workshop**: Fortuitous timing let the team go deep immediately and explore advanced workflows on the spot.
- **Immediate wins**: Highlights included pipeline automation work and a photos agent orchestration prototype.

## Strategic Context

### Part of a Company-Wide AI Initiative

The workshop was designed as an experiment to answer critical questions for the organization's AI transformation:

- What training formats drive sustained behavior change?
- How do developers respond to immersion vs. gradual adoption?
- What support structures prevent regression to old habits?

The data collected will inform AI adoption strategies for other platform teams (iOS, Windows).

### The Cultural Shift

The most significant outcome isn't the PRs -- it's the mindset change. The team embraced:

- **Agent-first thinking**: Always ask if an agent can do the task first
- **Prompt sharing over code hoarding**: Workflows stored in version control for reuse
- **Experimentation encouraged**: "Wild West" approach to prompt iteration
- **Sub-agent meta-review**: Using AI to validate AI-generated output

### Empowering Insights for Driving Adoption

- **Immersion over gradual rollout**: Modality shifts need protected time and space -- gradual adoption stalls at 30-40%
- **Strategic timing matters**: Post-holiday windows create natural psychological resets for embracing new workflows
- **Decentralized experimentation over standardization**: In rapidly evolving spaces, personal discovery beats top-down best practices
- **Growth mindset over gatekeeping**: Remove barriers to sharing -- psychological safety accelerates learning across the team
- **Peer learning builds community**: Shared exploration creates collective excellence and sustained momentum beyond individual motivation

### What's Next

- **January**: Track adoption metrics toward 70% sustained usage
- **Q1**: Graduate successful prompts into reusable skills and extensions
- **Ongoing**: Share learnings across the mobile organization
- **Team goal**: "No more new Java files" -- all new code in Kotlin/C++ with AI assistance

## Key Quote

"To every participant who leaned into the discomfort of learning a new way of working -- thank you. Changing your inner loop is hard. You did it together, and the team is now positioned to lead AI-first engineering."
